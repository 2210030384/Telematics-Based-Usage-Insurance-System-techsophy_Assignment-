**Telematics-Based Usage Insurance System 🚗📊**

This project is a smart insurance system that adjusts vehicle insurance premiums based on driving behavior. It uses telematics data such as speed, braking patterns, acceleration, and phone usage to calculate a **risk score** and offer personalized safety feedback.

---

## 💡 Project Objective

To simulate a usage-based car insurance system that:
- Analyzes real-time driving behavior
- Scores driving risk
- Adjusts insurance premiums dynamically
- Suggests safety improvements to drivers

---

## 🔧 Features

✅ Simulated telematics data (speed, acceleration, phone usage)  
✅ Risk scoring based on driving patterns  
✅ Premium adjustment based on score (safe → discounted, risky → surcharge)  
✅ Personalized safety recommendations  
✅ Simple and elegant frontend using Flask + HTML  
✅ Fully modular and database-free
